SmartR is still under heavy development!

To deploy your own visualization you need to add three files:
- An input views to specify the input
- An analysis script to compute statistical information
- An output view to visualize the final data

A very simplistic example can be found here:

- grails-app/views/_inSample.gsp
- web-app/Scripts/Sample.R
- grails-app/views/_outSample.gsp
