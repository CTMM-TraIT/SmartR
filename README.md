SmartR is still under heavy development!

To deploy your own visualization you need to add three files:
1. An input views to specify the input
2. An analysis script to compute statistical information
3. An output view to visualize the final data

A very simplistic example can be found here:

grails-app/views/_inSample.gsp
web-app/Scripts/Sample.R
grails-app/views/_outSample.gsp
