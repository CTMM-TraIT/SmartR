SmartR is NOT STABLE yet. You might find missing features, unreadable insanely complicated code or stuff which is simply wrong and does not work.

What will happen in the next days:

- Readme will be expanded

- Refactorings will be completed to have a runnable version while developements will happen on a seperate branch (the initial commit came from a private repository where no one cared about broken code)

- Documentation and sample files will be added where most needed
