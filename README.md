How to add SmartR to my tranSMART installation:
- coming soon

Knows Issues:
- none

Supported Browsers:
- Firefox (fully supported)
- Chrome (fully supported)
- Internet Explorer (mostly supported)
 
How to deploy your own visualization:
- Add an input view to specify the input data
- Add an analysis script to prepare/order/filter the data and to compute statistical information
- Add an output view to visualize the processed data

A very simplistic example can be found here:
